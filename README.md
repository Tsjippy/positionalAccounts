This module adds the posibility of having an account attached to a function rather than a person.

This adds the folowing benefits:<br>
* Roles and permissions can be added to a function and not to a person<br>
* Content can be published by a person.<br>
* When another user takes on the function you link his account to the positional account so they immideate access to all content and permissions of the old person.<br>
